MLDemos is an open-source visualization tool for machine learning algorithms created to help studying and understanding how several algorithms function and how their parameters affect and modify the results in problems of classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, dynamical systems and reward maximization.

It has been mainly authored by [Dr. Basilio Norris](http://mldemos.b4silio.com/) during his time as a PhD student in the [LASA](http://lasa.epfl.ch/) laboratory at EPFL. All the other contributors are credited in the AUTHORS file. MLDemos is open-source and free for personal and academic use.
